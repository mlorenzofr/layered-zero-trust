# Argo CD Sync-Wave Inventory

All `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` assignments in `layered-zero-trust`.

A +31 offset was applied to every value so that all waves are positive (>= 1), preserving the original relative ordering. This accommodates the Validated Patterns operator applying the Argo CD super-role later than before, which caused resources with negative sync waves to fail.

## Unified deployment timeline

Every sync-wave in the repository, in order. **App** = hub-level Argo CD Application creation. **chart** = resource inside a chart (resolved locally within that app's sync). **sub** = operator Subscription.

## Application-level waves (`values-coco-dev.yaml`)

The CoCo development configuration reuses several of the same components. Only the active `compliance-scanning` wave differs from the commented-out defaults; other entries are commented out but updated for consistency.

## Notes

- **"Old"** = value before the +31 offset. **"—"** = no sync-wave existed (defaulted to 0).
- **"Current"** = value after the +31 offset plus newly added application-level annotations.
- Template waves are resolved **locally within each app sync**, not globally. A template wave of 32 inside acs-central (app wave 41) does not conflict with a template wave of 32 inside noobaa-mcg (app wave 36); they run independently.
- Sync waves control **Application creation order**, not readiness. A later wave means the Application resource is submitted to the hub later, but the earlier app's pods may not be fully running yet. For hard readiness gates, use Argo CD health checks or resource hooks.
